# Rents in San Francsisco 2000-2018

[Kate Pennington](https://www.katepennington.org/data) created a panel of historic Craigslist rents by scraping posts archived by the Wayback Machine. You can read more about her work here

[What impact does new housing have on rents, displacement, and gentrification in the surrounding neighborhood? Read our interview with economist Kate Pennington about her article, "Does Building New Housing Cause Displacement?:The Supply and Demand Effects of Construction in San Francisco."](https://matrix.berkeley.edu/research-article/kate-pennington-on-gentrification-and-displacement-in-san-francisco/)

In our case, we have a clean(ish) dataset with about 200K rows that correspond to Craigslist listings for renting properties in the greater SF area. The data dictionary is as follows

| variable    | class     | description           |
|-------------|-----------|-----------------------|
| post_id     | character | Unique ID             |
| date        | double    | date                  |
| year        | double    | year                  |
| nhood       | character | neighborhood          |
| city        | character | city                  |
| county      | character | county                |
| price       | double    | price in USD          |
| beds        | double    | n of beds             |
| baths       | double    | n of baths            |
| sqft        | double    | square feet of rental |
| room_in_apt | double    | room in apartment     |
| address     | character | address               |
| lat         | double    | latitude              |
| lon         | double    | longitude             |
| title       | character | title of listing      |
| descr       | character | description           |
| details     | character | additional details    |

The dataset was used in a recent [tidyTuesday](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday) project.

```{r}
# download directly off tidytuesdaygithub repo

rent <- readr::read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/master/data/2022/2022-07-05/rent.csv')

```

What are the variable types? Do they all correspond to what they really are? Which variables have most missing values?

```{r skim_data}
## To view variable's data-types
str(rent)

## To get overview of dataset - number of missing values, range of values, etc

Make a plot that shows the top 20 cities in terms of % of classifieds between 2000-2018. You need to calculate the number of listings by city, and then convert that number to a %.

The final graph should look like this![](images/top_cities.png)

```{r top_cities}
# YOUR CODE GOES HERE

## Calculating listings by cities
top_cities_listing <- rent %>%
  group_by(city) %>%
  summarize(city_total_listings = n())

## Calculating total listings across cities
total_listings <- sum(top_cities_listing$city_total_listings)

## Calculating Percentage of listings by cities 
top_20cities_classified_listing<- top_cities_listing %>%
  group_by(city) %>%
  summarize(Percentage = city_total_listings*100/total_listings) %>%
  arrange(desc(Percentage)) %>%
  head(20)

## Graphing top 20 cities by Percentage of total listings of Craiglist
ggplot(top_20cities_classified_listing, aes(x =Percentage,y = reorder(city, -Percentage))) +  geom_bar(stat = "identity", fill = "grey") +
  labs(x = "Percentage of Listings", y = "Cities",
       title = "Top 20 Cities by % of Classifieds Craiglist Listings") 
```

Make a plot that shows the evolution of median prices in San Francisco for 0, 1, 2, and 3 bedrooms listings. The final graph should look like this

![](images/sf_rentals.png)

```{r sf_median_prices}

# YOUR CODE GOES HERE

## 
rent %>%
  filter(city == 'san francisco', beds %in% c(0,1,2,3)) %>%
  group_by(beds,year) %>%
  summarise(median_price = median(price, na.rm = TRUE)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(y =median_price,x = year)) +  
  geom_line(aes(color = factor(beds))) +
  labs(y = "Median Prices", x = "Years",
       title = "Evolution of median prices in San Francisco for 0,1,2,3 bedroom listings") + 
  facet_grid(~beds) + theme(legend.position = "none")
  
  

```

Finally, make a plot that shows median rental prices for the top 12 cities in the Bay area. Your final graph should look like this

![](images/one_bed_bay_area.png)

```{r spirit_plot}
# YOUR CODE GOES HERE

top_20cities_classified_listing_head12 <- top_20cities_classified_listing$city %>% head(12) 

rent %>% 
  filter(beds==1, city %in% top_20cities_classified_listing_head12 ) %>% 
  group_by(city,year) %>%
  summarise(median_price_city = median(price,na.rm = TRUE)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x= year, y=median_price_city,color = city)) + geom_line() +
  labs(x = "Year", y = "Median Price", color = "City") +
  facet_wrap(~ city, ncol = 4) +theme(legend.position = "none")

# Analysis of movies- IMDB dataset

We will look at a subset sample of movies, taken from the [Kaggle IMDB 5000 movie dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/carolzhangdc/imdb-5000-movie-dataset)

```{r,load_movies, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, eval=FALSE}

movies <- read_csv(here::here("data", "movies.csv"))
glimpse(movies)

```

Besides the obvious variables of `title`, `genre`, `director`, `year`, and `duration`, the rest of the variables are as follows:

-   `gross` : The gross earnings in the US box office, not adjusted for inflation
-   `budget`: The movie's budget
-   `cast_facebook_likes`: the number of facebook likes cast memebrs received
-   `votes`: the number of people who voted for (or rated) the movie in IMDB
-   `reviews`: the number of reviews for that movie
-   `rating`: IMDB average rating

## Use your data import, inspection, and cleaning skills to answer the following:

-   Are there any missing values (NAs)? Are all entries distinct or are there duplicate entries?
```{r, missing values and duplicate entries}


movies %>% head()
skimr::skim(movies)

any_duplicates <- any(duplicated(movies))

unique_df <- unique(movies)

unique_df

identical(movies,unique_df)
```


-   Produce a table with the count of movies by genre, ranked in descending order
```{r, count_by_genre}

movie_genre_counts <- movies %>%
  group_by(genre) %>%
  summarise(count = n()) %>%
  arrange(desc(count))

print(movie_genre_counts)

```

-   Produce a table with the average gross earning and budget (`gross` and `budget`) by genre. Calculate a variable `return_on_budget` which shows how many \$ did a movie make at the box office for each \$ of its budget. Ranked genres by this `return_on_budget` in descending order

```{r, return_on_budget}

genre_stats <- movies %>%
  group_by(genre) %>%
  summarise(average_gross = mean(gross, na.rm = TRUE),
            average_budget = mean(budget, na.rm = TRUE),
            return_on_budget = sum(gross, na.rm = TRUE) / sum(budget, na.rm = TRUE)) %>%
  arrange(desc(return_on_budget))

print(genre_stats)

```
-   Produce a table that shows the top 15 directors who have created the highest gross revenue in the box office. Don't just show the total gross amount, but also the mean, median, and standard deviation per director.

```{r, top_directors}

top15_directors_list<- movies %>%
  group_by(director) %>%
  summarise('Total gross revenue' = sum(gross),'Mean revenue' = mean(gross), ' Median' = median(gross), 'Standard Deviation' = sd(gross)  ) %>%
  arrange(desc('Total gross revenue')) %>%
  head(15)

top15_directors_list

```
-   Finally, ratings. Produce a table that describes how ratings are distributed by genre. We don't want just the mean, but also, min, max, median, SD and some kind of a histogram or density graph that visually shows how ratings are distributed.

```{r, movie_ratings}
rating_stats <- movies %>%
  group_by(genre) %>%
  summarise(mean_rating = mean(rating, na.rm = TRUE),
            min_rating = min(rating, na.rm = TRUE),
            max_rating = max(rating, na.rm = TRUE),
            median_rating = median(rating, na.rm = TRUE),
            sd_rating = sd(rating, na.rm = TRUE)) %>%
  arrange(desc(mean_rating))

rating_stats

ggplot(movies, aes(x = rating)) +
  geom_histogram() +
  facet_wrap(~ genre, ncol = 4) +
  labs(x = "Rating", y = "Frequency") 



```

## Use `ggplot` to answer the following

-   Examine the relationship between `gross` and `cast_facebook_likes`. Produce a scatterplot and write one sentence discussing whether the number of facebook likes that the cast has received is likely to be a good predictor of how much money a movie will make at the box office. What variable are you going to map to the Y- and X- axes?

```{r, gross_on_fblikes}
movies %>%
  group_by(genre) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x= cast_facebook_likes, y =gross)) + geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "auto") +
  facet_wrap(~genre, ncol = 3,scales = "free") + theme(panel.spacing = unit(0.2, "lines"))

## Overall Trend
movies %>%
  ggplot(aes(x= cast_facebook_likes, y =gross)) + geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "auto") 

## Correlation
head(movies)
cor(movies[4:8])

```

-   Examine the relationship between `gross` and `budget`. Produce a scatterplot and write one sentence discussing whether budget is likely to be a good predictor of how much money a movie will make at the box office.

```{r, gross_on_budget}

movies %>%
  group_by(genre) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x= budget, y =gross)) + geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "auto") +
  facet_wrap(~genre, ncol = 3,scales = "free") + theme(panel.spacing = unit(0.2, "lines"))

## Overall Trend
movies %>%
  ggplot(aes(x= budget, y =gross)) + geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "auto") 


```

-   Examine the relationship between `gross` and `rating`. Produce a scatterplot, faceted by `genre` and discuss whether IMDB ratings are likely to be a good predictor of how much money a movie will make at the box office. Is there anything strange in this dataset?

```{r, gross_on_rating}

movies %>%
  group_by(genre) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x= rating, y =gross)) + geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "auto") +
  facet_wrap(~genre, ncol = 3,scales = "free") + theme(panel.spacing = unit(0.2, "lines"))

## Overall Trend
movies %>%
  ggplot(aes(x= rating, y =gross)) + geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "auto") 

```

# Returns of financial stocks

> You may find useful the material on [finance data sources](https://am01-sep23.netlify.app/reference/finance_data/).

We will use the `tidyquant` package to download historical data of stock prices, calculate returns, and examine the distribution of returns.

We must first identify which stocks we want to download data for, and for this we must know their ticker symbol; Apple is known as AAPL, Microsoft as MSFT, McDonald's as MCD, etc. The file `nyse.csv` contains 508 stocks listed on the NYSE, their ticker `symbol`, `name`, the IPO (Initial Public Offering) year, and the sector and industry the company is in.

```{r load_nyse_data, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
nyse <- read_csv(here::here("data","nyse.csv"))
```

Based on this dataset, create a table and a bar plot that shows the number of companies per sector, in descending order

```{r companies_per_sector}
companies_per_sector <- nyse %>%
  group_by(sector) %>%
  summarise('number of companies' = n()) %>% 
  arrange(desc("number of companies"))

companies_per_sector
ggplot(companies_per_sector, aes(y = sector, x = `number of companies`)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", fill = "grey") +
  labs(y = "Sector", x = "Number of Companies", title = "Number of Companies per Sector")

```

Next, let's choose some stocks and their ticker symbols and download some data. You **MUST** choose 6 different stocks from the ones listed below; You should, however, add `SPY` which is the SP500 ETF (Exchange Traded Fund).

```{r get_price_data, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, cache=TRUE}
# Notice the cache=TRUE argument in the chunk options. Because getting data is time consuming, 
# cache=TRUE means that once it downloads data, the chunk will not run again next time you knit your Rmd

myStocks <- c("AAPL","JPM","DIS","DPZ","ANF","TSLA","SPY" ) %>%
  tq_get(get  = "stock.prices",
         from = "2011-01-01",
         to   = "2022-08-31") %>%
  group_by(symbol) 

glimpse(myStocks) # examine the structure of the resulting data frame
```

Financial performance analysis depend on returns; If I buy a stock today for 100 and I sell it tomorrow for 101.75, my one-day return, assuming no transaction costs, is 1.75%. So given the adjusted closing prices, our first step is to calculate daily and monthly returns.

```{r calculate_returns, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, cache=TRUE}
#calculate daily returns
myStocks_returns_daily <- myStocks %>%
  tq_transmute(select     = adjusted, 
               mutate_fun = periodReturn, 
               period     = "daily", 
               type       = "log",
               col_rename = "daily_returns",
               cols = c(nested.col))  

#calculate monthly  returns
myStocks_returns_monthly <- myStocks %>%
  tq_transmute(select     = adjusted, 
               mutate_fun = periodReturn, 
               period     = "monthly", 
               type       = "arithmetic",
               col_rename = "monthly_returns",
               cols = c(nested.col)) 

#calculate yearly returns
myStocks_returns_annual <- myStocks %>%
  group_by(symbol) %>%
  tq_transmute(select     = adjusted, 
               mutate_fun = periodReturn, 
               period     = "yearly", 
               type       = "arithmetic",
               col_rename = "yearly_returns",
               cols = c(nested.col))
```

Create a table where you summarise monthly returns for each of the stocks and `SPY`; min, max, median, mean, SD.

```{r summarise_monthly_returns}

# YOUR CODE GOES HERE

```

Plot a density plot, using `geom_density()`, for each of the stocks

```{r density_monthly_returns}

# YOUR CODE GOES HERE

```

What can you infer from this plot? Which stock is the riskiest? The least risky?

> TYPE YOUR ANSWER AFTER (AND OUTSIDE!) THIS BLOCKQUOTE.

Finally, make a plot that shows the expected monthly return (mean) of a stock on the Y axis and the risk (standard deviation) in the X-axis. Please use `ggrepel::geom_text_repel()` to label each stock

```{r risk_return_plot}
# YOUR CODE GOES HERE

```

What can you infer from this plot? Are there any stocks which, while being riskier, do not have a higher expected return?

# Challenge 1: Replicating a chart

The purpose of this exercise is to reproduce a plot using your `dplyr` and `ggplot2` skills. It builds on exercise 1, the San Francisco rentals data.

You have to create a graph that calculates the cumulative % change in median rental prices for 0-, 1-, and 2-bed flats between 2000 and 2018 for the top twelve cities in Bay Area, by number of ads that appeared in Craigslist. Your final graph should look like this. You may find `dplyr::first()` a useful function

# Rubric

Check minus (1/5): Displays minimal effort. Doesn't complete all components. Code is poorly written and not documented. Uses the same type of plot for each graph, or doesn't use plots appropriate for the variables being analyzed.

Check (3/5): Solid effort. Hits all the elements. No clear mistakes. Easy to follow (both the code and the output).

Check plus (5/5): Finished all components of the assignment correctly and addressed both challenges. Code is well-documented (both self-documented and with additional comments as necessary). Used tidyverse, instead of base R. Graphs and tables are properly labelled. Analysis is clear and easy to follow, either because graphs are labeled clearly or you've written additional text to describe how you interpret the output.
